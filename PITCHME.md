Note: My name is David Durden; I'm the Data Services Librarian for the University Libraries. If you have ever interacted with a librarian here on campus (which you all should have, *right?*), chances are they were working in Reference. 

Unlike those librarians which you *should* have met, I work down in the basement of McKeldin Library. I deal primarily with digital curation, data archiving, and data management.

Slides @ https://ter.ps/181015-dcc
@snap

Note: I'm going to briefly talk about refining research questions and generating search terms, and I'll introduce some places to start looking for resources as well as some entry-level data tools.

I do want to apologize in advance for any duplication in material presented here: I was asked to present loosely on the topic of research for data-based projects, so hopefully there is something of relevance for each of you throughout this presentation.

Let's get started.

@snapend

Note: One approach is to take a look at what various institutes and companies are currently doing in regard to design work (*even if they are at other Universities or in the public sector*)

### Inspiring Examples

@ul

- [Ideo](https://www.ideo.com/)
- [Y Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/)
- [Design Incubation Centre](http://www.designincubationcentre.com/)
- Relevant conferences?

@ulend

Note: 

Ideo is a company who pioneered in the field of design thinking. They emphasize human-centered design through collaboration, innovation, and creativity. *You may have heard of them.* The Ideo website features past projects, blogs that discuss approaches, successes, and failures, and some tools to get you started in design thinking. 

Y Combinator technically provides seed funding for start-ups. YC emphasizes technology, especially in Silicon Valley. However, the YC blog is a valuable resource for learning about the start-up mentality and being successful with technology. 

The Design Incubation Center is housed at the National University of Singapore. The DIC is a design research laboratory and the DIC website has a lot of creative focused research.

Conferences often publish their proceedings or make presentations/short-/long-papers available (*this is a great place to get the most current research and work in a given field*) Depending on what your project is, and what your personal field of study is, the conferences that may appeal to you is highly variable. If you don't know what conferences exist in your field, ask a professor sometime.

### Inspiring Examples at UMD

@ul

- [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](https://mith.umd.edu/research/)
- [Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory](http://hcil.umd.edu/research-areas/)
- [Research institutes and centers on campus](https://www.umd.edu/centers-and-institutes)

@ulend

Note:

The University you are currently attending also has a wealth of cutting-edge research and most institutes and research centers across campus make their research available through their websites.

Two centers that I think are appropriate for the DCC would be MITH and HCIL -- both are physically located in Hornbake Library.

If these centers don't fit your idea, you can browse all 238 centers on campus at the link provided in the slides.

<h2>@css[text-black](How do I find relevant *stuff*)</h2>
@snapend

### Strategize *then* Search

@ul 

- What are you really looking for?
- Dedicate time for random exploration
- Gather some ideas
- Discover some trends
- Expand your vocabulary

@ulend

Note: 

1. Cast a wide net first and then refine, e.g., broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep.

2. Your initial exploration phase may be painful. Avoid the urge to *pre-crastinate*.
3. Your initial ideas should be conceptual, theoretical, high-level
4. Look for thematic trends in seemingly disparate or unrelated topics
5. Reduce these themes into a set of core vocabulary terms--these will become your search keywords

+++

### Use references to your advantage

@ul

- Works cited = more articles for you
- Search the works of a single author

+++

### Document your adventure

@ul

- Keep a search term log
