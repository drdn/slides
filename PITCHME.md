Note: My name is David Durden; I'm the Data Services Librarian for the University Libraries. If you have ever interacted with a librarian here on campus (which you all should have, *right?*), chances are they were working in Reference. 

Unlike those librarians which you *should* have met, I work down in the basement of McKeldin Library. I deal primarily with digital curation, data archiving, and data management.

### Today's Plan

@ul

- Inspiration
- Strategy
- Tools

Slides @ https://ter.ps/181015-dcc
@snap

Note: I'm going to briefly talk about refining research questions and generating search terms, and I'll introduce some places to start looking for resources as well as some entry-level data tools.

I do want to apologize in advance for any duplication in material presented here: I was asked to present loosely on the topic of research for data-based projects, so hopefully there is something of relevance for each of you throughout this presentation.

Let's get started.

@snapend

Note: One approach is to take a look at what various institutes and companies are currently doing in regard to design work (*even if they are at other Universities or in the public sector*)

### Inspiring Examples

@ul

- [Ideo](https://www.ideo.com/)
- [Y Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/)
- [Design Incubation Centre](http://www.designincubationcentre.com/)
- Relevant conferences?

@ulend

Note: 

Ideo is a company who pioneered in the field of design thinking. They emphasize human-centered design through collaboration, innovation, and creativity. *You may have heard of them.* The Ideo website features past projects, blogs that discuss approaches, successes, and failures, and some tools to get you started in design thinking. 

Y Combinator technically provides seed funding for start-ups. YC emphasizes technology, especially in Silicon Valley. However, the YC blog is a valuable resource for learning about the start-up mentality and being successful with technology. 

The Design Incubation Center is housed at the National University of Singapore. The DIC is a design research laboratory and the DIC website has a lot of creative focused research.

Conferences often publish their proceedings or make presentations/short-/long-papers available (*this is a great place to get the most current research and work in a given field*) Depending on what your project is, and what your personal field of study is, the conferences that may appeal to you is highly variable. If you don't know what conferences exist in your field, ask a professor sometime.

### Inspiring Examples at UMD

@ul

- [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](https://mith.umd.edu/research/)
- [Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory](http://hcil.umd.edu/research-areas/)
- [238 campus research centers](https://www.umd.edu/centers-and-institutes)

@ulend

Note:

The University you are currently attending also has a wealth of cutting-edge research and most institutes and research centers across campus make their research available through their websites.

Two centers that I think are appropriate for the DCC would be MITH and HCIL -- both are physically located in Hornbake Library.

If these centers don't fit your idea, you can browse all 238 centers on campus at the link provided in the slides.

### Strategize => Search => Refine

@ul 

- What are you really looking for?
- Dedicate time for random exploration
- Collect some ideas
- Discover some trends
- Expand your vocabulary

@ulend

Note: 

Take some time to develop a search strategy that works for you. 

1. Cast a wide net first and then refine, e.g., broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep.

2. Your initial search may be painfully unproductive. Avoid the urge to *pre-crastinate*.
 
3. Your initial ideas should be conceptual, theoretical, high-level. From these concepts you can drill-down and get specific. 

4. Look for and analyze thematic trends in seemingly disparate or unrelated topics. Trends can help you both decide what to do, and what *not* to do.

5. Reduce these themes and ideas into a set of core vocabulary terms--these will become your search keywords. Use a thesaurus to find word variants; use official thesauri to discover how different indexes and catalogs are organizing information.

### Example Vocabularies

@ul
    
- [Library of Congress Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html)
- [Getty Institute Vocabularies](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/)
- Articles and search results often include subject terms and keywords!

@ulend

Note: The LoC subject headings are how most library systems in the United States arrange and describe their holdings. There is a bit of a learning curve regarding how to best navigate this resource, but it can be valuable. 

The Getty has developed several controlled vocabularies designed for the graphic arts and architecture. 

Whenever you find a relevant article in EBSCO or ProQuest, you will be able to see the search terms associated with the results. Keep track of these terms when collecting articles. Some publications, such as those published in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) format will usually include subject terms and keywords alongside the abstract.

### Use References in Relevant Papers

@ul

- Works cited == more sources for you
- Search the works of a single author
- Look for annotated and/or published bibliographies

@ulend
    @ul
    - *HINT:* Ask your reference librarian to help you find relevant materials!
    @ulend
    
Note: *Question to the group*: Has anyone ever gone down the Rabbit Hole on Wikipedia? Clicking link after link until you windup far from where you started? 

You can use the works cited and reference pages of things you read to lead you directly to other relevant resources. References are for more than fulfilling a submission requirement or complying with academic integrity standards.

### Document Your Adventure

@ul

- Keep a log of your searches

@ulend

    @ul

    - Search terms
    - Databases/platforms searched
    - Relevant results

    @ulend

@ul

- Reusing data? [Cite it!](http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/)

@ulend

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
[A nifty guide to keeping a lab notebook](https://colinpurrington.com/tips/lab-notebooks)
@snap

Note: Documenting your work is probably the most difficult part of research. Ask yourself: *"If I were to revisit this project a year from now, will I be able to pick up where I left off?"*

Even if you aren't performing lab-based research, you can apply
