Note: My name is David Durden; I'm the Data Services Librarian for the University Libraries. If you have ever interacted with a librarian here on campus (which you all should have, *right?*), chances are they were working in Reference. 

Unlike those librarians which you *should* have met, I work down in the basement of McKeldin Library. I deal primarily with digital curation, data archiving, and data management.

Note: I'm going to briefly talk about refining research questions and generating search terms, and I'll introduce some places to start looking for resources as well as some entry-level data tools.

I do want to apologize in advance for any duplication in material presented here: I was asked to present loosely on the topic of research for data-based projects, so hopefully there is something of relevance for each of you throughout this presentation.

Let's get started.

@snapend

Note: Look at institutes and companies currently doing design work (*even if they are at other Universities or in the public sector*)

### Examples

@ul

- [Ideo](https://www.ideo.com/)
- [Y Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/)
- [Design Incubation Centre](http://www.designincubationcentre.com/)
- Relevant conferences
- Others?

@ulend



Conferences often publish their proceedings or make presentations/short-/long-papers available (*this is a great place to get the most current research and work in a given field*)

### Who's doing what at UMD?

@ul

- [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)]()
- [Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory]()
- [Research institutes and centers on campus](https://www.umd.edu/centers-and-institutes)

### Strategize and Search

@ul 

- What are you really looking for?
- Dedicate time for random exploration
- Gather some ideas
- Discover some trends
- Expand your vocabulary

@ulend

Note: 

1. Cast a wide net first and then refine, e.g., broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep.

2. Your initial exploration phase may be painful. Avoid the urge to *pre-crastinate*.
3. Your initial ideas should be conceptual, theoretical, high-level
4. Look for thematic trends in seemingly disparate or unrelated topics
5. Reduce these themes into a set of core vocabulary terms--these will become your search keywords

+++

### Use references to your advantage

@ul

- Works cited = more articles for you
- Search the works of a single author

+++

### Document your adventure

@ul

- Keep a search term log
