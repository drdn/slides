### Intro

- @fa[info-circle] Inspiration
- @fa[database] Resources
- @fa[toolbox] Toolkit

Note: Apologies for any duplication in material. I was asked to present loosely on the topic of research for data-based projects. Hopefully there is something of relevance for each of you throughout this presentation.

## Who's doing what?

@ul

- Ideo
- Design Incubation Centre
- Relevant conferences
- Others?

@ul-end

Note: Look at institutes and companies currently doing design work (*even if they are at other Universities or in the public sector*)

Conferences often publish their proceedings or make presentations/short-/long-papers available (*this is a great place to get the most current research and work in a given field*)

## Strategize and Search

@ul 

- What are you really looking for?
- Dedicate time for random exploration
- Gather some ideas
- Discover some trends
- Expand your vocabulary

@ul-end

Note: 1. Cast a wide net first and then refine, e.g., broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep.

2. Your initial exploration phase may be painful. Avoid the urge to *pre-crastinate*.
3. Your initial ideas should be conceptual, theoretical, high-level
4. Look for thematic trends in seemingly disparate or unrelated topics
5. Reduce these themes into a set of core vocabulary terms--these will become your search keywords

### Document your adventure

@ul

- Keep a search term log

    @ul

    - Record the terms you have searched with
    - Record the database/platform you performed the search
    - Record the relevant results

    @ul-end

- Reusing data? Cite it like any other academic source

@ul-end
