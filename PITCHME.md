@snapend

Note: My name is David Durden; I'm the Data Services Librarian for the University Libraries. If you have ever interacted with a librarian here on campus (which you all should have, *right?*), chances are they were working in Reference. 

Unlike those librarians which you *should* have met, I work down in the basement of McKeldin Library. I deal primarily with digital curation, data archiving, and data management.

### Roadmap

@ul[](false)

- Inspiration
- Strategy
- Resources 

@ulend 

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
Slides @ https://go.umd.edu/181015-dcc
@snapend

Note: I'm going to briefly talk about refining research questions and generating search terms, and I'll introduce some places to start looking for resources as well as some entry-level data tools.

I do want to apologize in advance for any duplication in material presented here: I was asked to present loosely on the topic of research for data-based projects, so hopefully there is something of relevance for each of you throughout this presentation.

Let's get started.

@snap[west text-white]
<h2>Q1</h2>
@snapend

@snap[east span-70]
<h2>@css[text-black](Who's doing what?)</h2>

Note: One approach is to answering this question is to take a look at what various institutes and companies are currently doing in regard to design work (*even if they are at other Universities or in the public sector*) Ask yourself: Who is doing work in *x*? What things are related to *y*?

---

### Inspiring Examples

@ul

- [Ideo](https://www.ideo.com/) @note[Ideo is a company who pioneered in the field of design thinking. They emphasize human-centered design through collaboration, innovation, and creativity. *You may have heard of them.* The Ideo website features past projects, blogs that discuss approaches, successes, and failures, and some tools to get you started in design thinking.]
- [Y Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/) @note[Y Combinator technically provides seed funding for start-ups. YC emphasizes technology, especially in Silicon Valley. However, the YC blog is a valuable resource for learning about the start-up mentality and being successful with technology.]
- [Design Incubation Centre](http://www.designincubationcentre.com/) @note[The Design Incubation Center is housed at the National University of Singapore. The DIC is a design research laboratory and the DIC website has a lot of creative focused research. I'm not sure how useful it is as a resource or topic generator, but I did find when running some basic searches for design cultures.]
- [Library of Congress Labs](https://labs.loc.gov/) @note[LC Labs is a great resource for getting familiar with the digital collection of the Library of Congress. LC Labs encourages people to utilize their materials in their teaching and projects.]ss
- Relevant conferences? @note[Conferences often publish their proceedings or make presentations/short-/long-papers available (*this is a great place to get the most current research and work in a given field*) Depending on what your project is, and what your personal field of study is, the conferences that may appeal to you is highly variable. If you don't know what conferences exist in your field, ask a professor sometime.]

### Inspiring Examples at UMD

@ul

- [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)](https://mith.umd.edu/research/) @note[Two centers that I think are appropriate for the DCC would be MITH and HCIL -- both are physically located in Hornbake Library.]
- [Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory](http://hcil.umd.edu/research-areas/)
- [238 campus research centers](https://www.umd.edu/centers-and-institutes) @note[If two these centers don't fit your idea, you can browse all 238 centers on campus at the link provided in the slides.]

@ulend

Note:

The University you are currently attending also has a wealth of cutting-edge research and most institutes and research centers across campus make their research available through their websites.

<h2>Q2</h2>
@snapend

@snap[east span-70]
<h2>@css[text-black](How do I find relevant *stuff*?)</h2>
@snapend

Note: Great question.

---

### Strategize => Search => Refine

@ul 

- What are you really looking for? @note[Cast a wide net first and then refine, e.g., broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep. Write out a long form question and then reduce to a few words and phrases.]
- Dedicate time for random exploration @note[Your initial search may be painfully unproductive. Avoid trying to find all of your sources in one setting. Avoid the urge to *pre-crastinate*. We'll discuss this more, later.]
- Collect some ideas @note[Your initial ideas should be conceptual, theoretical, high-level. From these concepts you can drill-down and get specific.]
- Discover some trends @note[Look for and analyze thematic trends in seemingly disparate or unrelated topics. Trends can help you both decide what to do, and what *not* to do. This can also be a great source of creativity and discovery of novel ideas.]
- Expand your vocabulary @note[Reduce these themes and ideas into a set of core vocabulary terms--these will become your search keywords. Use a thesaurus to find word variants; use official thesauri to discover how different indexes and catalogs are organizing information.]

@ulend

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
Slides @ https://go.umd.edu/181015-dcc
@snapend

Note: 

Take some time to develop a search strategy that works for you. Your experience will vary. Using citation managers like Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote (if you have a subscription), or BibTex (if you're into that sorta thing.) 

+++ 

### Example Vocabularies

@ul
    
- [Library of Congress Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) @note[The LoC subject headings are how most library systems in the United States arrange and describe their holdings. There is a bit of a learning curve regarding how to best navigate this resource, but it can be valuable. ]
- [Getty Institute Vocabularies](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/) @note[The Getty Research Institute has developed several controlled vocabularies designed for the graphic arts and architecture. ]
- Articles and search results often include subject terms and keywords! @note[Whenever you find a relevant article in EBSCO or ProQuest, you will be able to see the search terms associated with the results. Keep track of these terms when collecting articles. Some publications, such as those published in the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) format will usually include subject terms and keywords alongside the abstract.]

### Wait, Wait, Wait! 

Don't let yourself explore too far.

![xkcd/time](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/munroe-2a.jpg?w=600)

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
[Relevant xkcd (well, sort of. It was *actually* published in *TIME*.)](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/munroe-2a.jpg?w=600)
@snapend

Note: *Question to the group*: Has anyone ever gone down the Rabbit Hole on Wikipedia? Clicking link after link until you windup far from where you started? Don't let yourself get bogged down by trying to find too many resources. Take a break; especially if you find yourself far from where you started.

---

### Use References from Relevant Papers

@ul

- Works cited == more sources for you
- Search the works of a single author
- Look for annotated and/or [published bibliographies](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/) @note[if you're following along with the slides, this link will take you to the Oxford Bibliographies]
- *HINT:* [Ask](https://umd.libanswers.com/) a reference librarian to help you find relevant materials! @note[Ask Us! is a combination FAQ and live chat page where you can send reference and research questions to librarians on campus.]

@ulend

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
Slides @ https://go.umd.edu/181015-dcc
@snapend
    
Note: You can use the works cited and reference pages of things you read to lead you directly to other relevant resources. References are for more than fulfilling a submission requirement or complying with academic integrity standards.

---

### Document Your Adventure

@ul

- Keep a log of your searches @note[Organize your keywords and results in notebook or a spreadsheet. Recording the URL of *where* and *when* you found a resource will help you in the long run.]

@ul

- Search terms @note[Keep track of your search terms because your research will probably use similar words.]
- Databases/platforms searched @note[Knowing where you found something is useful for searching for similar materials later.]
- Relevant results and date accessed @note[If you find something useful, keep track of it. Dates are also useful because you'l need that info for your citations.]
- Reusing data? [Cite it!](http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/) @note[If you plan on reusing someone else's data, be sure to generate a citation for it. Attribution is good for us all.]

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
[A nifty guide to keeping a lab notebook.](https://colinpurrington.com/tips/lab-notebooks)
@snapend

Note: Documenting your work is probably the most difficult part of research. Ask yourself: *"If I were to revisit this project a year from now, will I be able to pick up where I left off?"*

Even if you aren't performing lab-based research, you can apply the organizational strategies of keeping a lab notebook (follow the link at the bottom of the slide for more info).

### Plan and Document with a Data Management Plan

![dmptool](assets/dmptool.png)

Login at [https://dmptool.org]()

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
Disclaimer: I work in data management and I'm a little enthusiastic about DMPs.
@snapend

Note: DMPTool is a website that hosts templates for various data management plans. While mostly aimed at researchers applying for funding from various grant awarding agencies, DMPs can be a useful tool for thinking through who will have access to your stuff, where your stuff comes from, where your stuff is stored, and where your stuff will live once you're finished with it.

DMPs are useful for project management and project planning.

### Know Where to Search

@ul

-Search the catalog and local resources
- [UMD Library Catalogue](https://umaryland.on.worldcat.org/advancedsearch) @note[This is useful for casting a wide net. The catalog will search local resources, consortial (Inter-Library Loanable) materials, and other items held at various insitutions.]
- [The Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM)](https://www.drum.lib.umd.edu) @note[This is where faculty deposit some of their research works. You can find pre-prints and technical reports. Grad students also deposit their theses and dissertations here.]

### Know Where to Search

@ul

- Search through specific indexes/databases/publishers
- [Design & Applied Arts Index](https://search.proquest.com/daai/advanced?accountid=14696) @note[The Design & Applied Arts Index makes searchable a variety of scholarly works focused on graphic and industrial design, and a variety of other art and architecture related publications.]
 - [ACM Digital Library](https://dl-acm-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/) @note[A great resource when looking for scientific papers related to computer science and technology.]
- [Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute](https://www.mdpi.com) @note[MDPI publishes a wide variety of interdisciplinary research in open access journals.]
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) @note[A pre-print archive for physics, math, computer science, stats, and more.]
- [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/) @note[A repository of pre-prints for the arts & humanities, social sciences, education, and law.]

### Know Where to Search

@ul

- Just *Google* it. @note[Sometimes a non-scholarly approach can return useful, academic resources.]
- [Google Scholar](https://www.scholar.google.com) @note[But, of course, there's always Google Scholar.]
- TIP: Set up [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for awesome passive search results delivered right to your inbox. @note[Once you have a bunch of search terms, you can set up some Alerts have Google deliver the freshest results right to you.]

### Know How to Search

@ul

- Boolean operators (AND, NOT, OR)
- Boolean values (True/False)
- Platform specific search operators (e.g., Google, ProQuest, WorldCat)

@ulend

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
[Relevant slides for advanced searching in Google](https://drdn.github.io/presentations/20180214-g-search-strategy.pdf)
@snapend

Note: There's a separate logic to search academic and library databases. Google works really well with both natural language and boolean searching, but library databases will almost always work better with logical queries.

---

### Wait, I'm Looking for Data!

@ul

- [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org) @note[re3data is a searchable registry of hosted datasets and data repositories. The registry has an emphasis on research data and academia, but this means that datasets discovered should also point to relevant research papers.]
- [data.gov](https://www.data.gov) @note[The U.S. Government's Open Data portal. A one-stop shop for data and data tools. Useful data when dealing with US lands and populations.]
- [The National Data Service](https://www.nationaldataservice.org) @note[The NDS is a consortial effort to improve research data infrastructure in the U.S. This site provides tools, data, and exposes some of the projects supported by the NDS and the Research Data Alliance, which is an international organization aimed at improving the sharing and access to research data. While the site does have some data, it also points to a lot of data related literature and tools.]
- [wikidata.org](https://wikidata.org) @note[OK. Wikidata is really cool. Wikidata is a human & machine readable linked data platform powered by the Wikimedia Foundation. Through this website, you can generate sub-sets of data from SPARQL queries (which is a query language for the semantic web), or you can edit or add new items. Wikidata provides resources to make your underlying application data better, but it is also a great place to get started working with data--it's super useful for connecting people, places, and ideas.]

### No, I Need More Data!

@ul

- [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) @note[538 is a data analysis blog founded by Nate Silver (author of *The Signal and the Noise*). (*Without cheating,* does anyone know the relevance of the number 538? Answer: its the number of electors in the US Electoral College.) 538 makes all of the data used in its visualizations, predictions, and articles available for reuse through its github page.] 
- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) @note[This is a huge collection of public datasets arranged by topic. While public, not all of the datasets are free. APD also points to some data challenges, which may also be a useful for idea generation.]
- [Free Music Archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/) @note[An archive of free music. It's pretty sweet.]
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Library](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) @note[A collection of machine learning ready datasets. If ML is your thing, this is a great collection of resources.]

### MORE DATA.

@ul

- [US Building Footprints](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints/) @note[Created by Microsoft, this dataset has building shapes and locations for almost every building in the United States. Granted, there are some errors, but it is an open dataset.]
- [A map of every building in America (based on the dataset above)](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/12/us/map-of-every-building-in-the-united-states.html) @note[If you didn't see this article last week, you should check it out ASAP. It's built using the US Building Footprints dataset.]
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) @note[Not presented as a dataset, but can be used with various metadata harvesting methods to generate datasets. Python has a module for data mining the Internet Archive and the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/data-mining-the-internet-archive) has a tutorial on how to use it.]

### Tools for Managing Research and Data

@ul

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) @note[Jupyter Notebooks are an integrated environment for putting code, text, and graphics all in one place. This link will take you to a datacamp tutorial on setting up Jupyter in Python.]
- [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) @note[OpenRefine is an excellent way to explore, clean, transform, and restructure data in a graphic interface. Granted, there are more technical ways to do a lot of what OpenRefine accomplishes (e.g., Python's Pandas Library or R). OpenRefine runs in a web browser and lets you interact with substantially more data than Excel (it also won't reformat or overwrite your existing data).]
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) @note[Zotero is a free tool for collecting and organizing citations and full-text research materials. If used correctly, you can organize by project, format citations, and have access to pdfs of collected research all in one place. Other options exist, such as EndNote and Mendeley.]
- Git and Github @note[Version control is your friend. Depending on the level technical development required for your project, git and github may not be a good option. Github is open and accessible to the entire web, so think about the possibility of having your work scooped before committing everything to GH. Github does have a private repository option, but it comes with a monthly fee.]

### This is My Life

Substitute *literally any website* for *news site*. 

![xkcd/2054](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/loop.png)

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
[Relevant xkcd no.1411](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/loop.png)
@snapend

Note: Technology can be excruciatingly distracting. Don't trick yourself into procrastinating by learning or being 'productive'. Learn to recognize the signs.

Some examples of this are:

- cleaning your apartment/dorm/house to avoid work
- learning a cool, but irrelevant skill (e.g., the case of [Donald Knuth writing a book and inventing TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#History) because he didn't like what his book looked like in the galley proofs)

---

### Get to Know Yourself

[Pre-crastination](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/why-i-taught-myself-to-procrastinate.html) vs. procrastination.

@snap[south template-note text-gray]
Slides @ https://go.umd.edu/181015-dcc
@snapend

Note: [pre-crastination](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614532657) is the "hastening of subgoal completion at the expense of extra physical effort." Otherwise known as the urge to start a task and complete it immediately.

Knowing which of these behaviors match your natural tendencies is the first step to being more productive in a qualitative sense. Trying to find all of your sources in one sitting is difficult and can be counter-productive. Remember to look for sources that are applicable, not just those that meet the minimum requirements.

@quote[Am I rushing to complete things, or am I avoiding doing things all together?]

Note: Ask yourself, *"do I rush to complete things or do I avoid doing them all together?*
